The following are some helpful links to documentation

## markdown

There are different dialects of the markdown 'language' and notebooks use the github
version which is optimised / extended for programming.

  - <a href="/files/Documentation/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf"> PDF version </a>

## `python` language

Google is probably your best friend in this section and, when you do a google search, the
stack overflow pages are often the most helpful ones to home in on.

## numpy & scipy

The pdf version of the `numpy` manual is on this system (numpy doesn't change much from version to version
but you might see some small variations). Likewise the `scipy` manual but here you might find it helpful to access
the inbuilt help commands in a notebook to double check.

  - <a href="/files/Documentation/scipy-ref-0.19.0.pdf"> scipy: PDF user manual </a>


## matplotlib

The matplotlib documentation tends to be very technical and deals with the underlying implementation in detail. Most helpful is the thumbnails gallery

  - [matplotlib homepage](http://matplotlib.org)
  - [matplotlib gallery](http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html)
  - [matplotlib examples](http://matplotlib.org/examples/index.html)

  - <a href="/files/Documentation/Matplotlib-user-2.0.0.pdf"> PDF user manual </a>

## cartopy

  - [`cartopy` home page](http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/)
  - [`basemap` home page](http://matplotlib.org/basemap/)
  - ['cartopy gallery'](http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/v0.15/gallery.html)

## stripy

There is no user manual other than the examples and that is because we wrote this package recently and have still to do a manual.
The underlying algorithms themselves are in ancient fortran code that we wrapped in python and
made friendly. The papers for this are listed in the examples.

## quagmire

No user manual for this beyond the tutorial. But there is a preprint:
